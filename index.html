            Hello! My name is Elle Vuotto and I am currently a senior student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am majoring in biomedical engineering with a concentrtaion in biomedical instrumentation and a minor in computer science. I am an athlete for the women's soccer team and the track team here at Rose. I have a few acomplishments for the soccer team including being a two-time all-conference HCAC player and being acaedmic all-conference. As for clubs, I am apart of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and Chi Alpha Sigma (a national college athlete honor society). 
        </p><p>
            I am a Hoosier, born and raised. However, all my sport affiliations remain in Philadelphia: Go birds, phils, and flyers! I have small family, including my mom and dad and my sister and I. My parents are both doctors and my sister is in the progression of becoming a lawyer. I also now have a new brother in-law as of one month ago. Out of college I hope to move back to my hometown with the rest of my family and stay there for a while!
